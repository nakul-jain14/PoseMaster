# PoseMaster

Welcome to PoseMaster, a project that utilizes machine learning to detect the pose of a person in real-time using a webcam. The project is powered by PoseNet, a part of the ML5.js library, which is a pre-trained model capable of estimating a person's pose in both images and video streams.

## Overview

PoseMaster provides an engaging and interactive experience by leveraging the capabilities of machine learning. Through a dynamic stick figure overlay on the video stream, PoseMaster visualizes key points representing the detected pose. 

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection**: PoseMaster detects the pose of a person in real-time using a webcam.
- **Alphabet Pose Recognition**: The model is trained to recognize four alphabet poses: Y, A, M, and C.
- **Interactive Experience**: When a user strikes one of these poses, the corresponding letter is displayed on the screen, showcasing the accuracy and responsiveness of the machine learning model.
